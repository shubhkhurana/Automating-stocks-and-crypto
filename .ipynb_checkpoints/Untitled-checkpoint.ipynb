GameStop was flat in afterhours trading following the news. GameStop (NYSE:GME) reported a net loss of $2.08 a share, more than double the loss of $1.01 a share in same period last year. Revenue rose to $1.38 billion from $1.28 billion a year earlier. Wall Street expected a loss of $1.22 on revenue of $1.27 billion. Inventory rose to $917.6 million for the quarter, up from $570.9 million in the prior year’s first quarter, reflecting a \"continued focus on improving in-stock levels in merchandise to meet increased customer demand and offset supply chain headwinds,\" the company said. Looking ahead, the company said it took steps to support the recent launch of a digital asset wallet to allow gamers and others to store, send, receive and use cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens across decentralized apps. \"The wallet extension will enable transactions on GameStop’s NFT marketplace upon its intended launch in the second quarter,\" it added.

       "  \"Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre and Brian Cheung join the Live show to break down data on job openings in April, the market and sector actions heading into the day's final trading hour, the bond market, and meme stocks. DAVE BRIGGS: What are we learning today about job openings across the country? BRIAN CHEUNG: Yeah, Dave, as you mentioned, we got data this morning from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, detailing all of the job market turnover that we see. This is different than the monthly employment report that you tend to see. But what we really want to look at is, how many job postings are employers trying to fill? And if you take a look at the chart of what job openings look like, you can see that actually, it didn't really tick down all that much between March and April, which was the latest data that we got as of this morning. 11.4 million job openings, extremely elevated by historical levels. Businesses having a difficult time staffing up. We saw that the quits rate also remain elevated at 4.4 million. We did, however, see the layoffs rate decline to 0.8%, so not that many people getting laid off of their job, at least in the month of April. That is, by the way, a series low, at least from the Bureau of Labor Statistics since they began collecting this report. So, all in all, it shows that even with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, they haven't necessarily slowed the demand for hiring. Still very difficult for employers to find workers right now, guys. SEANA SMITH: All right, thanks so much, Brian. And Jared, you're taking a look at the markets. It's the first trading day of June. Some fear, though, still in the markets, as there's worry over the economic growth. JARED BLIKRE: Yes, there is, Seana. And let's take a look at the charts here.

       "  'GameStop, the embattled video game store and meme stock, launched a non-custodial Ethereum browser wallet in beta on Tuesday. Users control their assets and must manage the wallet’s private keys themselves. The wallet is available from the Chrome Web Store for the Chrome and Brave browsers, and an iOS version of the app is “coming soon.” The new wallet precedes GameStop’s NFT marketplace, which the video game store expects to launch by September. In February, GameStop announced a partnership with Immutable X, an Ethereum Layer 2 for NFTs, to build the marketplace and launch a $100M development fund. Loopring will also help develop GameStop’s NFT marketplace. GameStop’s wallet supports Layer 2 transactions on the Loopring rollup network. Loopring transactions are cheap, and secured by Ethereum’s base layer. Etherscan estimates that transfers on the Ethereum mainnet cost about $1.30 and swaps are priced at $10.45. The same transactions cost $0.02 and $0.50 on Loopring, according to L2fees. GameStop’s brick-and-mortar shops suffered when the gaming industry went mostly online-only, but the company’s stock went viral in early January after retail investors piled in. The price of GME surged from $19 to highs of $483 in January 2021 before crashing to $40 in February. GME then hit $342 last June but now trades for $96. In its fourth quarter financials, GameStop reported losses of $147.5M, equating to a loss of $1.94 per share. While plenty of crypto fans are looking forward to GameStop’s NFT marketplace, gamers have pushed back against NFTs, criticizing the energy expenditure associated with Proof-of-Work and the extractive business models game studios use when leveraging nonfungible tokens. In February, Team17, the developer of Worms, canceled plans to launch NFTs less than one week after its announcement drew criticism from fans and one of its development partners. During the same month, Electronic Arts (EA) CEO Andrew Wilson said the company is no longer “driving hard” on NFTs. Sega announced NFTs in April 2021, but after persistent criticism, the company said it will “carefully assess” users’ concerns before launching them.

The S&P 500 fell 0.6% in a choppy session, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 222 points, or 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.4%. [Click here to read what's moving markets on Wednesday, June 1] These moves come after all three indexes logged weekly gains of more than 6% Friday, clawing back from seven consecutive losing weeks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and eight weeks of losses for the Dow. May marked another volatile month for equity markets as concerns over inflation and interest rate hikes weighed on sentiment. Despite a mostly downbeat month, the S&P 500 and Dow each closed marginally higher for the month, while the Nasdaq extended its losses by 2%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose Tuesday amid a broader relief rally in cryptocurrencies. Oil futures pared gains late in the session after a jump in early trading following reports Chinese authorities were poised to end a two-month COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai and an agreement by EU leaders to stop purchases of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia. WTI crude oil futures climbed 3.6% to $118.70, while Brent crude oil futures rose 3.7% to $123.83. Shares of movie theater giant AMC (AMC) jumped as much as 10% in intraday trading but closed slightly lower following the debut of TOP GUN during Memorial Day weekend. U.S. theaters saw an estimated 122% year-over-year increase from last year's holiday weekend, AMC said in a statement Tuesday, underscoring positive signs of a post-COVID recovery for the industry. Before Tuesday's close, AMC's stock surged nearly 40% across the prior three sessions. Wall Street’s rally last week came on the heels of a favorable batch of quarterly earnings in recent trading sessions, which helped temporarily mitigate concerns over the toll of inflation on corporate profits.

       "  'Reddit\\'s war over GameStop stock has claimed a major casualty. Bloomberg and The New York Times report Melvin Capital, the hedge fund considered the nemesis of the meme stock affair, is shutting down. Fund owner Gabe Plotkin told investors that the \"appropriate next step\" after steep losses was to liquidate assets and return cash to investors, and that it was time to \"step away\" from managing others\\' capital. At least half of the cash will transfer by May 31st, with the rest coming by June 30th. Melvin Capital had been a successful fund, starting 2021 with over $12 billion. However, its public bet against GameStop and other struggling companies made it one of the largest victims of a GameStop-centric investing spree by people coordinating across Reddit and social networks. Plotkin\\'s fund reported a 53 percent loss in January 2021, and it took a $2.75 billion cash infusion to soften the blow and keep losses down to 39 percent for the year. The GameStop saga wasn\\'t the only factor involved, however. While a recovery appeared possible, Melvin posted a 23 percent loss through April that was partly linked to poor stock positions. The fund was clearly in peril after the Reddit battle — it\\'s just that some miscalculations finished the company once and for all. Reddit speculators shifted their attention to BlackBerry and other companies in the aftermath of the GameStop drama, and there hasn\\'t been fallout on par with Melvin\\'s in the months since. Still, the shutdown illustrates the power of coordinated internet investors — they can demolish conventional stock managers in the right circumstances. Aurora Cannabis Inc.

       " 'TSLA': ['Get Fully Briefed with Yahoo Finance, delivered straight to your inbox. The S&P 500 and the Dow lost ground after Microsoft made a surprise cut to its earnings outlook and comments from a Federal Reserve official quashed recent optimism about an eventual pause in the central bank\\'s rate hike moves. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors fell on Thursday, with healthcare , utilities and consumer staples stocks leading the declines. Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said she thinks a half-point rate hike in the next couple of Fed meetings is reasonable, and sees little case for pausing rate hikes in September. \"The market are sensing that the move so far has done little to rein in the inflationary pressures and therefore, the sense is that they\\'re going to have to get more aggressive and that\\'s just causing continued kind of angst and nervousness in the market,\" said Kenny Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors. \"Not a disaster, but certainly nervousness.\" Microsoft fell 2.4 per cent after the company became the latest US corporation to warn of a hit to its profits from a stronger dollar. It cut its fourth-quarter forecasts for both profit and revenue. US stock indexes staged a strong rally towards the end of May to recoup earlier losses in the month, as signs that inflation may have peaked led investors to speculate that the Fed may not raise rates as much as previously expected. The Fed will also be looking at the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday that will shed light on the health of the labour market. Economists are expecting the economy to have added 325,000 jobs last month. \"If we get a weak number (tomorrow) that is close to this, that means maybe the tight labour market is beginning to show cracks and that will be a relief for the Federal Reserve,\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, said.

In 2018, Elon Musk said he wanted to create a Supercharger station with a restaurant and drive-in. Tesla\\'s plans could help boost EV adoption by turning charging stations into fun destinations. Tesla is planning to build a Supercharger station with a 24-hour diner and a drive-in movie theater in Los Angeles, according to a report from Bloomberg. The electric-car maker filed the plans with the city of Los Angeles on May 19, according to the publication. Tesla plans to build the luxury supercharger station at 7001 West Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, per Bloomberg. Electrek was the first to report on the plans, citing a tweet with a schematic of the two-story diner in the 9,300-square-foot space. The site will have 28 Supercharger stalls and two movie screens that can accommodate over 200 people, Bloomberg reported.

       "  'If you’re considering buying one, you may be asking yourself, is a Tesla worth it? The cheapest car, the Tesla Model 3, starts at $42,690. In addition to their purchase price, car insurance costs for Teslas are greater than that of other vehicles. On average, it can cost more than double to insure a Tesla than a standard gas-powered car. Fortunately, Tesla now offers its own insurance for its high-tech electric vehicles. We’ll look at whether Teslas Insurance is worth it and what other car insurance options might be better for your needs and budget. 6 Genius Hacks All Costco Shoppers Should Know In recent years, Tesla has become enormously popular. Currently headed by CEO Elon Musk, the company delivered 936,222 vehicles in 2021. Its revenues for the year totaled $53.82 billion, a 71% increase compared with 2020. Before you head to a Tesla store, make sure you consider the cost of auto insurance. When it comes to your typical car, the average cost of car insurance is $1,483 per year. However, coverage for Teslas is substantially more expensive. Why? There are several reasons: Luxury: With their high price tags, Teslas are considered luxury cars. Although the Model 3 starts at $42,690, other Tesla models have much higher price tags, such as the Model X, which starts at $109,690. As luxury vehicles, Teslas will be more expensive to insure than your typical coupe or sedan. Complex technology: Teslas boast high-tech systems, including its touch screen display, electric powertrain, and autopilot features. If the car is damaged and needs repairs, finding technicians that are able to work on those systems can be difficult — and expensive. Body shop limitations: Not all body shops are equipped to work on Teslas, so you’re limited to Tesla-approved shops. Coverage needs: With their high price tags and complex electronics, a Tesla isn’t a car to skimp on with insurance. To properly protect yourself and your vehicle, you’ll need comprehensive and collision insurance coverage with fairly high limits, typically more than state-minimum coverage. Along with its high purchase price and the cost to charge a Tesla,',\n",
       "  'Elon Musk delivered an ultimatum to Tesla and Space X’s corporate workforces: Spend a minimum of 40 hours a week in the office, or leave the company. Musk today confirmed in a tweet that screenshots of an email sent to workers was real. According to The New York Times, workers at both companies received similar memos from Musk that made clear that all workers must report to a main office for 40 hours a week. Musk also wrote that employees would no longer be allowed to work from “remote branch” offices not related to their job duties, giving the example of an HR worker for the Fremont factory who works out-of-state. “The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” Musk said in a memo to SpaceX employees obtained by NYT. “That is why I spent so much time in the factory — so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, SpaceX would long ago have gone bankrupt.” Musk taking a hardline stance on remote work is in stark contrast to a number of other major tech companies that have allowed all or most workers to request to work-from-home permanently, including Facebook, Twitter, Salesforce and Slack. Apple recently suspended a requirement that workers return to the office at least three days a week. As Bloomberg reported today, Twitter employees — who are likely to be reporting to Musk once his acquisition of the company is complete — have internally expressed some concern the SpaceX and Tesla remote work policies (or lack thereof) herald unwelcome changes for their own workplace. Tesla’s career website still lists a number of salaried and hourly remote positions. It’s unclear whether the new policy will apply to those positions. Engadget has reached out to Tesla for comment, though we are unlikely to hear back: the company dissolved its corporate communications department in 2020. Elon Musk is calling Tesla executives back to the office—and using factory workers’ demanding schedules to justify his orders.  The Tesla CEO sent out an email on May 31',\n",

Responding to an individual on Twitter, who had asked for an update on Tesla\\'s manufacturing plant in India, Musk responded, \"Tesla will not put a manufacturing plant in any location where we are not allowed first to sell & service cars.\" Tesla and the Indian government have been engaging for more than two years to evaluate a pathway for the electric carmaker to enter the world\\'s second most populous nation but are stuck in a deadlock. The Indian government has insisted that Tesla commits to opening a manufacturing plant in the country, so that it can assemble cars locally in the nation, and follow high import duties until it does if it wishes to sell its vehicles. The U.S. firm, on the other hand, is seeking lower import taxes in India so it can first test the market by selling cheaper imported electric vehicles before committing to a manufacturing base. Tesla incorporated a subsidiary in India early last year and registered an office in the city of Bengaluru in Karnataka. The Southern Indian state of Karnataka said shortly afterwards that Tesla \"will be opening an electric car manufacturing unit in Karnataka.\" But the two are now at a standstill. “If Elon Musk is ready to manufacture Tesla in India, then there is no problem,” India\\'s Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said at an event last month.

       "  \"Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this electric car maker have returned -12.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has lost 11.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Tesla is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.7%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.18 points to a change of +64.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.

       "  'Luminar, the U.S. lidar company, is the latest to poach executives from Apple, Nvidia and Tesla in the continuing talent war in automated driving and autonomous vehicle technology. Christopher “CJ” Moore, director of autonomous systems at Apple and former director of Tesla’s Autopilot software, has joined Luminar as VP of software. Taner Ozcelik, founder of Nvidia\\'s Automotive Business, has become executive vice president and general manager responsible for research and development and Luminar’s semiconductor subsidiaries, among other areas. Tesla’s chief IP Counsel, Chris Lubeck, is now head of intellectual property. Hiring former Tesla employees is notable, given CEO Elon Musk’s vocal stance against the technology. He called lidar a “crutch” and a “fool’s errand” at Tesla’s Autonomy Day in 2019. Lidar (an acronym for “light detection and ranging”) is a remote sensing method that can measure the car’s distance from objects and pedestrians. The system uses a laser to send pulses of light and a sensor that measures how long it takes the light to return. Autonomous driving companies including Cruise and Waymo use it to create 3D maps around the car. Automakers such as Mercedes are starting to turn to the sensor to offer more robust advanced driver assistance systems in passenger vehicles sold to consumers. Musk called lidar expensive and unnecessary, choosing instead to use radar, ultrasonic sensors and cameras to support its advanced driver assistance system called Autopilot and its so-called \"Full Self-Driving\" system, which is a $12,000 upgrade and is not self-driving. Tesla later removed radar as well. However, there have been reports that Tesla is using lidar as a training tool for its system. Other key hires include Jackie Chen, former president of Harman International, China, and Jared Jacobs, a former ZF Group executive who joined as Luminar’s VP of manufacturing operations. Luminar expects that series production cars will come equipped with the company’s lidar over the next year.  “Within the next 12 months there’s going to be series production cars that are Luminar-equipped that are out there advancing this industry forward,” Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell said at the TechCrunch Mobility conference'],\n",

But doing the opposite -- buying it at the US market open and selling it at the close -- spits out negative returns. “The bulk of Bitcoin’s gains have come outside of regular trading hours for US equities,” wrote Gordon in a note. Cryptocurrencies trade 24/7 and the strategy is hypothetical, an attempt to showcase just how sensitive crypto markets are to moves in US equities. And it’s difficult to say why the trend might work this way, said Gordon, though it appears the correlation to equities is a big factor this year. “It’s a more risk-averse market. In other words, stocks and cryptos are higher up on the risk spectrum, thus have sold off hand in hand,” he said.

On-chain spending shows selling in losses in the market. The crypto market has been struggling to find a direction in the unpredictable market since there is no directional bias either indicating an uptrend or a downtrend.  But the king coin is not giving up, and after noting a good 24 hours, Bitcoin is finally preparing to reclaim a critical zone. After marking a local top back at the end of March, bitcoin began falling on the daily chart, and the run only ended a week ago.

Since the last week of May, the leader of cryptocurrencies has been attempting to make a move upwards and close above the 23.6% Fibonacci level. This Fib level represents significant support for the crypto that two months ago was above $48 A bounce from this level would set Bitcoin up for a good rally ahead or at least a sustained sideways momentum with a gradual incline.

The white dots for the Parabolic SAR have run their course trying to support an uptrend, but they will not be changing positions and move above the candlesticks, signaling a downtrend. This is because, in the while that the uptrend was active, it failed to gain enough traction to maintain its strength.

       "  'A Bitcoin mining ban? Not quite, but still not a good idea, says one of the most prominent voices in crypto. On Friday, New York State Senate lawmakers passed a bill that will halt permits for new cryptocurrency mining facilities that use carbon-based fuel, due to environmental concerns. Widely and inaccurately reported as a ban on Bitcoin mining, the bill still awaits the signature of Governor Kathy Hochul. If it becomes law, it will impose a two-year moratorium on cryptocurrency mining operations that use proof of work (PoW) to validate transactions. Whatever the nature of this ban, it was not well-received by the cryptocurrency community, including Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin retweeted Bruce Fenton, the former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, who is running for New Hampshire Senate, and noted that he agreed with Fenton’s tweet, which said: “No government has the right to tell you what software to run.” “I oppose banning PoW,” Buterin tweeted on Saturday. https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1533104260916752384?s=20 Under PoW, cryptocurrency miners race to solve complex puzzles to validate transactions, a process that requires a lot of equipment and computer power. Bitcoin and Ethereum currently use PoW, but Ethereum plans to shift to a different, more energy-efficient method this summer. Though Buterin supports Ethereum’s move away from PoW, he said on Twitter that it’s “a bad idea” for the government to be “picking and choosing which specific applications are an okay use of electricity or not.” Rather than ban new PoW-run projects, it’s “better to just implement carbon pricing, and use some of the revenues to compensate low-income users,” Buterin said. While the Senate voted 36–27 to pass the bill and send it to Gov. Hochul’s desk, mining companies have threatened to leave New York if the moratorium is signed into law.

       "  'By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) - As the crypto winter creeps into June, the first signs of a thaw are emerging. Some investors are now betting that bitcoin is bottoming out, judging by the money heading into listed cryptocurrency funds, which represent just a slice of the market yet are popular among institutional and retail players alike. Overall flows into such funds turned positive last month, with a weekly average inflow of $66.5 million, a reversal from a dismal April when they saw a weekly average outflow of $49.6 million, according to data provider CryptoCompare. \"It\\'s largely institutional, and to a degree retail investors, recognizing that the pain is already endured, and we\\'re closer to the bottom than we are to the top,\" said Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of Arizona-based IDX Digital Assets. \"If you\\'re getting into crypto at these levels, a little near-term volatility could be worth a long-term payoff,\" he added. \"A lot of institutional investors are starting to look at crypto as a source of longer-term growth potential.\" It\\'s hard to know whether the tentative flows will last, though, or if the nascent trend will be replicated across the wider market. Many people will also think twice before piling into the market again, having been mightily clobbered as crypto was buffeted by worries over global monetary tightening and rising inflation. Bitcoin has lost roughly half its value since a November peak, it is down by a third in 2022 and has been languishing at around $30,000 for a month. The data from funds nonetheless indicate some investors are returning to crypto, albeit into the perceived safety of exchange-traded products (ETP) with their promise of greater liquidity and security.

       "  'Since crypto’s drawdown in early May, investors in digital coins have been selling off their tokens and buying Bitcoin at a pace not seen in almost a year. Currently trading above $31,200, up more than 4% in the last day, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now makes up 47.3% of crypto’s total market cap, according to TradingView. Bitcoin hasn’t played such a dominant role in investors’ portfolios since July 30, 2021, when the asset traded above $42,000. The increasing value relative to crypto’s total market cap suggests investors are seeking it as a safer investment during a period of contraction, which Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have deemed the “crypto winter.” “Bitcoin is probably the most volatile major asset in history,” Andy Edstrom, managing director of advisory services with Swan Bitcoin, a bitcoin trading app, told Yahoo Finance. “But the reality is that its volatility has come down over the many years it has been in existence.” Created during the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis, bitcoin proponents originally envisioned it as an electronic cash outside of the monetary control of governments. Between those early days and now, advocates have altered their thinking, most often likening it to “digital gold” as Edstrom pointed out. While volatility has proven to be one of its main characteristics, data from Coin Metrics shows bitcoin’s whipsaw fluctuations have dropped over time. Since December, BTC has moved at an increasing lockstep with the stock market, especially high-growth technology stocks. Following the crypto market’s sell-off in early May, during which the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has seen a sharp drop, though it remains at levels higher than at any point in 2021. Off 54% since its November 2021 peak of $68,789, the asset has performed 9% worse than Meta ($FB) but held out 16% better than Netflix ($NFLX) in that time.

       "  'Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have often been called an excellent inflation hedge. \\xa0However, USD’s purchase power against BTC has been in an uptrend for the most part of this year. Over the last two quarters, amid largely bearish market conditions, socio-political issues have played a key role in establishing BTC’s price trajectory.\\xa0 Cryptocurrencies as investments are attractive for several reasons. For some, cryptocurrencies are a quick way to earn money as they chant ‘wen Lambo,’ while for others, it’s the trust in blockchain technology or a certain project. For some, getting into cryptos could be as basic as jumping on the hype train, primarily due to FOMO. All that aside, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have often been called an excellent inflation hedge and a store of value. So, as inflation continues to rise, where do cryptocurrencies and inflation cross paths? Inflation is when the decreasing value of a currency, like the US dollar, increases the price of goods and services over time, thus helping the economy grow. However, unlike fiat currencies, cryptos can’t be manipulated to the same extent by changing interest rates, or so they said. In early May, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied on the news of interest hike by FEDs, rising about 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Soaring inflation has been one driver of broad losses across the crypto markets. The United States Federal Reserve announced a 0.5% hike in interest rates, the highest hike ever in interest rates in the last two decades. While cryptocurrencies saw short-term price spikes after the news of the interest hike, the price gains couldn’t sustain. Many analysts, however, still believe that cryptocurrencies have been behaving in line with equities, similar to a big tech stock. In the post-pandemic era, USD’s buying power against BTC fell further, taking a significant dip in March 2020, followed by another drop towards the end of 2020, as seen above. Additionally, the USD’s value has further dipped due to the government’s continuous money printing. Over the last 50 years, inflation has already reduced the value of the USD by 85%, which strengthened BTC’s narrative as an excellent',\n",
       "  'On Thursday, bitcoin rose by 2.18% to log a fifth daily gain from six sessions. While market angsts over inflation and Fed monetary policy lingered, a NASDAQ rally delivered support ahead of Friday’s US nonfarm payroll numbers. Bitcoin (BTC) technical indicators flash red, with bitcoin sitting at the 100-day EMA. On Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) gained 2.18%. Partially reversing a 6.27% slide from Wednesday, bitcoin ended the day at $30,440. A mixed start saw bitcoin fall to an early morning low of $29,574 before finding support. Steering clear of the day’s Major Support Levels, bitcoin rallied to a late intraday high of $30,647. Falling short of the First Major Resistance Level at $31,389, however, bitcoin slipped back to sub-$30,500. A lack of regulatory chatter left bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the hands of the US equity markets. A NASDAQ rally delivered support through the afternoon session. Today, the Fear & Greed Index fell from 13/100 to 10/100 despite bitcoin’s return to $30,000. While falling deeper into the “Extreme Fear” zone, the Index held above May’s low of 8/100. Regulatory uncertainty and investor jitters over the economic outlook, inflation, and Fed monetary policy remain market negative. On Friday, US nonfarm payroll figures (NFP) for May could define the Fed’s interest rate path through to September. We, therefore, expect bitcoin sensitivity to Friday’s figures. Disappointing US nonfarm payroll figures from the ADP delivered the NASDAQ with support on Thursday. According to the ADP, nonfarm payrolls increased by 128k in May, falling short of a forecasted 300k rise. In April, US nonfarm payrolls had risen by 211k. The latest 24-hour liquidation figures reflected improving investor sentiment. According to Coinglass, 24-hour BTC liquidations stood at $117.21 million, down from $350 million levels, and just $0.459 million for the last hour. At the time of writing, BTC was up 0.04% to $30.453. Bitcoin rose to an early high of $30,490 to test resistance at $30,500 at the turn of the day. BTC will need to avoid the $30,220 pivot\\xa0to target the First Major Resistance Level at $30,866. BTC would need the broader crypto market']}"
